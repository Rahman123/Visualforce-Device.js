This is a simple example of how you can combine Visualforce with Device.js to build cross-device web applications on the Force.com plaform. [Device.js](https://github.com/borismus/device.js) uses [CSS3 Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/Media_queries) to dynamically determine the type of device accessing the page (e.g. phone vs tablet vs desktop) and then automatically redirects the user to the Visualforce page appropriate for the respective form factor.

More details about this sample application can be found [here](http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/?p=8611).
